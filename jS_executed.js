let n = 2
function square(num){
    let ans = num * num
    return ans;
}
let square2 = square(n)
let square3 = square(4)

//Here the first thing it does is elocates places for each variable
// ex: n,square,square1, square2 =Undefined

// then excuted process starts line by line solving the equations
